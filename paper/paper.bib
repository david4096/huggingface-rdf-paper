  abstract  = "An increasing number of researchers support reproducibility by
               including pointers to and descriptions of datasets, software and
               methods in their publications. However, scientific articles may
               be ambiguous, incomplete and difficult to process by automated
               systems. In this paper we introduce RO-Crate, an open,
               community-driven, and lightweight approach to packaging research
               artefacts along with their metadata in a machine readable manner.
               RO-Crate is based on Schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, aiming to
               establish best practices to formally describe metadata in an
               accessible and practical way for their use in a wide variety of
               situations. An RO-Crate is a structured archive of all the items
               that contributed to a research outcome, including their
               identifiers, provenance, relations and annotations. As a general
               purpose packaging approach for data and their metadata, RO-Crate
               is used across multiple areas, including bioinformatics, digital
               humanities and regulatory sciences. By applying “just enough”
               Linked Data standards, RO-Crate simplifies the process of making
               research outputs FAIR while also enhancing research
               reproducibility. An RO-Crate for this article11
